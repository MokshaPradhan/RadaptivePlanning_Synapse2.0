This project spearheads a novel approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation through a data-driven platform powered by reinforcement learning (RL) & Generative AI (GenAI).

## Project Overview

* **Global Data Integration:** Aggregates environmental data from diverse sources (satellite imagery, climate models, APIs) to understand climate risks and vulnerabilities across regions.
* **Machine Learning Analysis:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to prepare and pre-process environmental data for RL and GenAI models.
* **Reinforcement Learning for Policy Optimization:** Employs an RL agent trained on simulations to iteratively refine climate action plans. The agent learns by receiving rewards for maximizing long-term resilience and minimizing climate risks.
* **GenAI for Plan Generation and Adaptation:** Leverages GenAI to generate diverse climate action plans based on insights from the RL agent. The GenAI continuously adapts these plans by incorporating feedback from real-world policy outcomes.
* **Adaptive Policy Formulation:** Continuously learns from implemented policies' outcomes using machine learning, enabling ongoing refinement of decision-making processes.

## Scalability and Feasibility

* **Scalability:** Cloud infrastructure and accessible data sources allow for easy expansion to new regions and challenges.
* **Feasibility:** Securing partnerships for data access, computational resources for training RL and GenAI models, and domain expertise in environmental science and AI are crucial for project implementation.
